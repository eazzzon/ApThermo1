About pyAp
=====================================
pyAp is a python package for calculating magmatic volatile, trace element concentrations, and oxygen fugacity using mineral apatite. 

Code authors: Weiran Li (University of Cambridge, U.K.) & Yishen Zhang (KU Leuven, Belgium) 

Introduction
#########

pyAp includes multiple apatite-based models developed by W. Li and co-authors, including:

* ApThermo: a thermodynamic model for calculating melt H :sub:`2` O (and CO :sub:`2` ) concentrations (following Li & Costa, 2020, GCA)

  - Inputs:  Apatite F, Cl and H :sub:`2` O (if available) concentrations; Temperature and melt Cl and/or F concentrations (for calculating melt water)
  
  - Outputs: Apatite stoichiometry (atom per fomula unit); Exchange coefficients for OH-Cl and/or OH-F; H :sub:`2` O concentrations in the melt
  
  
* ApREE2O3: a lattice strain-thermodynamic model for calculating melt trace element (including REE) concentrations and oxygen fugacity ( *f* O :sub:`2`) (following Li et al, in review)

  - Inputs:  Trace element concentrations in apatite and melt (be it melt inclusions/groundmass/whole rock)
   
  - Outputs: Partition coefficients of unmeasured trace elements; oxygen fugacity of the melt (if Eu was measured)

* More modules will be added in the future (ApTimer - Li et al. 2020 EPSL; ApZone - Li et al. in prep).
